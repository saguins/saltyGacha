# Welcome to 'saltyGacha' Project by SAGUINS
Write in **Java** programming language. Using if-else, for-loop, switch-case and a little bit about Class. This project can build something more on it, like how often did I get SSR? how often did I get this units?

This project is a prototype of [Overhit Gacha Simulator by GameFever](https://overhit.gamefever.co/gacha/)

## Let's talk about this case.
- 99 units.
- Rarity Probability
  - SSR 2%
  - SR 25%
  - R 73%
- get 10 units per one. Guarantee 1 units that have SR rarity or better.

Enjoy!

## 🎃 Hacktoberfest TO-DO list! 🎃
Since between October 1 and October 31 is **Hacktoberfest**, I want to improve this project and I want to see how far this project can go. This is my first Hacktoberfest so feel free to send any pull request. Any beginner is welcome too!
- [x] **Gacha Unit Name List.** More recognisable than numbers. (Thank you to [Name Generator](https://www.name-generator.org.uk/fantasy/))
- [ ] **Improve display.** like, 5 units per row, display [NEW] text when you get a new unit, etc.
- [x] **Gacha Result.** when you quit a Gacha Simulator, you can see how much SSR, SR and R units that you get. (Result in numbers and percentages are acceptable.) (Thanks to **EikeSan**)
- [x] **Gacha Counter.** how much time did you try again? (Thanks to **pshkrh**)
- [ ] **Exchange System.** It's like, 200 coins per one. You need to enter a number of you coin before you use a Gacha Simulator. If you out of your coin, you can't try again anymore.
- [ ] **Gacha Simulator GUI!**
- [ ] Others statistic results.

**Contributors during Hacktoberfest:** pshkrh, EikeSan.
